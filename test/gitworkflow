The steps in a Git workflow can vary depending on the specific workflow being followed, but here are the typical steps involved in a basic Git workflow like GitHub Flow:

Create a Branch: Developers create a new branch from the main branch (usually master or main) to work on a new feature, bug fix, or improvement. This isolates their changes from the main codebase until they are ready to be merged.

Work on the Branch: Developers make changes, commit them locally, and push the branch to the remote repository as needed. They iterate on their changes until they are satisfied with the result.

Open a Pull Request (PR): Once the feature or fix is complete, the developer opens a pull request to merge their branch into the main branch. This allows other team members to review the code and provide feedback.

Code Review: Team members review the changes in the pull request, providing feedback, suggestions, and approving the changes if they meet the project's standards.

Merge the Pull Request: Once the pull request has been approved and any necessary changes have been made, the branch is merged into the main branch. This integrates the changes into the main codebase.

Deployment: If applicable, the changes are deployed to the production environment. This step may involve additional testing and quality assurance processes.

Cleanup: After the changes have been merged and deployed, the feature branch may be deleted to keep the repository clean.

These steps are iterative and may be repeated for each new feature or fix in the project. Additionally, some workflows may include steps for managing releases, handling hotfixes, and coordinating with other development teams or stakeholders.
